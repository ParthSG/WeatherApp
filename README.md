Weather App

Created By Parth Gurjar

To run this application I would use Android Studio.
If you are using an emulator, I used the Pixel XL API 30 but I think any device with API above API 24 should work.
I recommend to use your own physical device because location on emulator is set to Mountain View (Google HQ) by default.
Otherwise you can change the city by clicking on the 'Change City'.
Then you can enter the city name and click enter.

Also I'm sorry I wasnt able to write some tests for this application but I can do it if you require.
